**📖 How It Works**
User Input: The user enters a city name in the search bar.

Coordinate Fetch: The app calls the Geocoding API to find the exact latitude and longitude for that city.

Weather Fetch: Using those coordinates, a second request is sent to the Open-Meteo API.

UI Update: The application parses the JSON response and updates the temperature, wind, and icons dynamically.
